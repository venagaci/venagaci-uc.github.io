        <p> <b>Course Overview:</b>
        <i>This course delves into the intricacies of web application development and hacking, 
            equipping us with essential skills in both areas. 
            Through a blend of theory and hands-on practice, we explore the foundational elements of front-end development, 
            including HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as back-end development using PHP and MySQL. 
            A key focus is understanding the architecture of web applications and the symbiotic relationship between client-side
            and server-side components. Moreover, we delve into the realm of web application security, where they uncover common 
            vulnerabilities and attacks through practical exercises. The course aims to empower us with the ability to develop secure and robust web 
            applications while arming them with the knowledge to identify, prevent, and mitigate potential security threats. By combining theoretical concepts with real-world examples, 
            students gain practical experience in designing and implementing web-based solutions that adhere to secure programming practices and principles. Overall,
            this course prepares us to navigate the complex landscape of web development and cybersecurity, enabling them to build resilient and secure web applications in accordance with industry standards.</i> </p>

         <h2>Overview of this individual project</h2>
         <i>
            For this project, I'm tasked with developing and deploying a Professional Profile Website on GitHub Pages. The website will serve as a comprehensive profile,
             including my resume details such as my name, headshot, contact information, educational background, work experiences, and skills. 
             Additionally, I'll create a separate page to introduce the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and related hands-on projects. 
             To meet the non-technical requirements, I'll utilize an open-source CSS framework like Bootstrap to ensure a polished appearance, and
             I'll target the profile towards potential employers as part of my job application. Furthermore, I'll integrate a page tracker, such as Google Analytics or Flag Counter, 
             to monitor website traffic and engagement. On the technical side, I'll implement basic JavaScript functionalities such as digital and analog clocks, show/hide email functionality, and 
             one additional feature using jQuery and another JavaScript framework or library. Additionally, I'll integrate two public Web APIs: the jokeAPI to display a new joke every minute and another public API with graphics,
             such as XKCD or Weatherbit, to incorporate graphical data into the website. Lastly, I'll use JavaScript cookies to personalize the welcome message, displaying "Welcome to my homepage!" 
             for first-time visitors and "Welcome back! Your last visit was [date/time]" for returning visitors. This project aims to showcase my skills in front-end web development, JavaScript programming, API integration, and cloud deployment.

        <h2> What I have learnt in Lab 1 and Lab 2: </h2>
           <p> <i>Throughout Lab 1 and Lab 2, I gained a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of web application development and
                honed my skills in programming, scripting, and utilizing essential web technologies. In Lab 1, I familiarized myself with the HTTP protocol and
                gained practical experience in developing basic web applications using CGI in C and PHP. Understanding HTTP requests
                and responses, as well as the handling of user input, was instrumental in laying the groundwork for more advanced tasks.
                In Lab 2, I delved deeper into front-end development by creating HTML files with forms and integrating JavaScript to add dynamic functionality 
                such as displaying the current date/time, logging key presses, and implementing digital and analog clocks. Additionally, I explored the integration of Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and Web APIs,
                allowing me to enhance the interactivity and responsiveness of web applications. By applying these skills in subsequent assignments, such as constructing Ajax requests to fetch data from external APIs and utilizing 
                CSS and jQuery to enhance the user experience, I further solidified my understanding and proficiency in web development. Overall, these labs provided me with a solid foundation in web application development and equipped me with the necessary 
                skills to tackle more advanced challenges in future assignments and projects.</i>

        <h2> What I have learnt in Hackathon-1 </h2>
         <p>
        <i>Hackathon 1 delved into the intricacies of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and defenses, offering participants a hands-on journey through web application security.
            Task 1 introduced seven levels of reflected XSS challenges, tasking participants with injecting code to trigger alerts displaying their names.
            Each level presented escalating difficulty, demanding strategic exploitation of vulnerabilities within the echo.php application.
            Participants' abilities to identify and exploit XSS vulnerabilities were put to the test, with additional points awarded for accurately identifying the source code vulnerabilities. 
            Task 2 shifted focus to defense strategies, requiring participants to reinforce vulnerable code from previous labs. By implementing input validation and encoding methods, participants fortified the front-end interface against potential XSS attacks. 
            This practical approach provided invaluable insights and skills applicable to real-world scenarios, deepening participants' understanding of web application security and enhancing their proficiency in securing web applications against malicious exploits.</i>
